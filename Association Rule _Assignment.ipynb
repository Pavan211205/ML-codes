measure the strength of a rule. It quantifies how much more likely an event (e.g., the purchase of item Y) is to occur given another event (e.g., the purchase of item X), compared to its baseline likelihood. In other words, lift tells us whether the occurrence of item X increases the likelihood of item Y.\n","       #Formula : Lift(X --> Y)= Suppotrt(X U Y)/(Support(X)*Support(Y))\n","  # *Support(X∪Y): The proportion of transactions that contain both X and Y.\n","    #*Support(X): The proportion of transactions that contain X.\n","  # *Support(Y): The proportion of transactions that contain Y.\n","#Importants of Lift in Association Rules:\n","#1.Measures Strength of Association\n","#2.Helps Filter Out Spurious Rules\n","#3.Useful for Business Decisions\n","\n","\n","#2.

Handling Large Datasets (Scalability)\n","#Challenge: As datasets grow larger, the number of itemsets and rules increases exponentially.\n","#Impact: Computational complexity makes it difficult to process big data efficiently.\n","#Solution: Techniques like Apriori pruning, FP-Growth, and parallel processing help optimize performance.\n","\n","#2. High Number of Rules (Redundancy & Interpretation)\n","#Challenge: ARM often generates too many rules, many of which are trivial or redundant.\n","#Impact: Hard to interpret meaningful insights due to an overwhelming number of rules.\n","#Solution: Rule pruning techniques (e.g., setting high support & confidence thresholds, using lift & conviction metrics).\n","\n","#3. Difficulty in Handling Continuous Data\n","#Challenge: ARM requires categorical data, but many real-world datasets have continuous values (e.g., price, age).\n","#Impact: Data must be discretized, leading to loss of information.\n","#Solution: Apply discretization techniques like binning or clustering.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Vr6T546Wcp38"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
